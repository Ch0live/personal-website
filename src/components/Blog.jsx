        <h1>
            Hello world!
        </h1>
        <h2>
            This is my new space on the internet for blogging and other content I create
        </h2>
        <p>
            Ideally I'd like to add a Markdown interpreter like Jekyll to this part of my personal site,
            where I can simply dump .md files and have fully formatted posts.
            However, I also want to build this system from the ground up to understand exactly how it works,
            taking shortcuts with a pre-built GitHub pages site is too easy and I'll lose learning and customization
            opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now this space will remain rather blank as I work on this site.
            I hope to add more content here in the future.
        </p>
